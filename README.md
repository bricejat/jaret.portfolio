# portfolio
Creating a simple website to showcase my resume while also understand and learning html and css. Going to use this website to have my resume, hobbies, and projects and education history showcased.

# Reason
I wanted to use my HTML and CSS skills to edit and showcase some technical skills to future employers.
HTML & CSS are great tools for creating a great foundational base for future coding languages that I plan on exploring and creating projects with
+fun

# Images rule
I am unsure if the images will come out right with this on a public website but I plan to post a code to run these images efficiently if not I will run it through some friends so get another idea of what to do

# License
I have a MIT License attached to this right now, I'm sure if it's wrong I'll hear about it but for now we rocking with that.
